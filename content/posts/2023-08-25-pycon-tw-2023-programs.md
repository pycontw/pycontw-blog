### 開放空間 Open Spaces

開放空間是自助式的聚會活動。是由與會者當場計畫的。在大會期間，四樓南北棟的兩側走道會擺設數張桌子，代表不同的開放空間，每張桌子上面都會有個看板，看板即為該空間的主題。你可以找到你有興趣的主題，隨時使用一旁的便利貼給予一些想法或是回饋。如果找不到你想討論的主題，那就直接在還沒有主題的空間上面填寫吧！詳細資訊請參考[這裡](https://hackmd.io/@pycontw/S1XFoGZhh/edit)。

The open space is a self-organized gathering activity. It's planned on the spot by the attendees. During the conference, several tables will be set up on both sides of the fourth-floor corridors in the north and south wings, representing different open spaces. Each table will have a sign indicating the theme of that space. You can find a theme that interests you and use the nearby sticky notes to share ideas or feedback at any time. If you can't find the topic you want to discuss, feel free to write on an empty space without a theme! For more information, please refer to [the page](https://hackmd.io/@pycontw/S1XFoGZhh/edit).
