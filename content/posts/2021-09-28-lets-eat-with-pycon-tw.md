The upcoming PyCon TW is on October 2nd and 3rd! ü§©

It was exciting to chat with new friends at lunch time.

Due to COVID-19, PyCon TW 2021 will be held online. Instead of chatting face to face, the participants can interact with others at the Soothing Forest on Gather.Town. We can also share our lunch photos on Discord! üç±
