PyCon APAC 2015 provides a soft Sofa-Zone.


It’s a good place to take a rest between the sessions. You can chat and meet new friends there, exchange your name cards, bring a cup of tea/coffee and just sit down, or look outside the window and figure out your \_future\_(code). Trust me, it would be one of your favorite corner during PyCon APAC.
