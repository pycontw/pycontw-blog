# PyCon Taiwan Blog

## Prerequisite

1. Create a GitHub Account  
   Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account. This will allow you to store, manage, and share your projects.

2. Download a Code Editor (e.g., VSCode)  
   To write and edit code, a code editor is required. Consider using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Download and install it on your computer.

3. Understand Version Control  
   Git is a tool for version control, which helps you track changes in your project. It allows you to manage edits, undo mistakes, and collaborate easily with others.

4. Why Use Git?  
   Git allows multiple people to work on the same project efficiently. For example, if you want to contribute to the `pycontw-blog` project hosted on Github, youâ€™ll need to **fork** and **clone** the repository before making changes.  

   More details can be found in the **"Fork & Clone pycontw-blog"** section.

5. Install Git  
   To start using Git for version control, install it on your computer.  

   - Download Git from the official site: [Git Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
   - For step-by-step installation and usage, watch this guide:  
     [Git Installation and Usage Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKXRiAiQFiY&t=103s)

## Getting Started
### Environment Setup

1. Fork & Clone [pycontw-blog](https://github.com/pycontw/pycontw-blog)

    For those who already know how to fork the repository, you can skip to the next step.

    1.1 Navigate to [pycontw-blog](https://github.com/pycontw/pycontw-blog) and press the `Fork` button
    on the top right corner.

    1.3 Copy the URL of the forked repo

    </details>

2. Clone the forked repo

    ```bash
    git clone --recursive <YOUR_URL_HERE>
    ```

3. Create a New Branch

    Before creating a post or making any changes (such as bug fixes or feature additions), always create a new branch. This ensures that your work remains separate from the main branch.

    **Important**: Make sure you're on the `main` branch before creating a new branch. You can switch to the main branch using the following command:

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```

    Then, create a new branch by running the command below, replacing "branch-name" with a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., add-new-post, fix-typo, add-feature-x).

   ```bash
   git checkout -b "branch-name"
   ```

4. Install [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install)

    Use `miniconda` to setup the required version of Python.
    Choose the code to execute depending on your OS.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
    curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh -o ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
    bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
    rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
    ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh
    ```
    </details>

    bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
    rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
    ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh
    ```

    start /wait "" miniconda.exe /S
    del miniconda.exe
    ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
    ```
    </details>

    <summary>(click me) Linux</summary>

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
    bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
    rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
    ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
    ```
    </details>

5. Setup Python & Pipenv

    ```bash
    conda create -y -n py-blog python=3.10 pipenv
    conda activate py-blog
    ```

6. Install Dependencies
    ```bash
    pipenv install --dev
    ```

7. Setup [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks

    This will check common errors when you do certain types of git commits.

    ```bash
    pipenv run inv setup-pre-commit-hooks
    ```

### Write a new article

#### Quick Start

1. Create Post

    Run the following command to create a new post. Follow the steps to fill in all necessary information.

    ```bash
    pipenv run inv create-post
    ```

    Then open the newly created file under `content/posts` to finish editing the rest of the content body.
    The post is written in Markdown format. You can learn more about Markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

2. Test Locally

    It's very ***IMPORTANT*** to test and run locally before committing anything. Run the following command to host the website locally.

    ```bash
    pipenv run inv livereload
    ```

    After executing the above command, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`.
    You should be able to see the new post you've just created.

3. Commit

    After all is ready, it's time to commit the modifications to the branch and push to the repository.

    ```bash
    git add <your_file>

    # Use commitizen to do git commit.
    # Choose the "new post" type if you're adding a new article
    pipenv run cz commit

    # Push to the remote branch.
    git push origin $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
    ```

4. Create Pull Request

    After pushing to the remote, go back to your github page of the forked repository. There should be a very obvious pop up on top of the page like below
    <details>
    <summary>Click me</summary>
    <img src="content/images/pr_step_1.png" />
    </details>

    Press that `Compare & pull request` hardly and go to the next page.

    <details>
    <summary>Click me</summary>
    <img src="content/images/pr_step_2.png" />
    </details>

    Modify the content of the red rectangle 1 and 2. After editing, press the `Create pull request` button. That's it!!

Congratulations!! You've done all the jobs to post a new blog article. The next is taking a rest, drinking a cup of tea, and waiting for the maintainer to come for reviewing your PR ~


#### More about the post

The post could be written in Markdown or reStructuredText format. The file should put under `content/posts` folder. Your filename should be the English title of your article. You'll have to translate it if there's no English title.

The following is a minimal example of an article.
* In markdown
    ```markdown
