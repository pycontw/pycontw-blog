# PyCon Taiwan Blog

## Prerequisite

1. Create a GitHub Account  
   Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account. This will allow you to store, manage, and share your projects.
   If you already have a GitHub account, please sign in before continuing with the README document. Without logging into your account, you will not be able to fork the project.

2. Download a Code Editor (e.g., VSCode)  
   To write and edit code, a code editor is required. Consider using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Download and install it on your computer.

3. Understand Version Control  
   Git is a tool for version control, which helps you track changes in your project. It allows you to manage edits, undo mistakes, and collaborate easily with others.

4. Why Use Git?  
   Git allows multiple people to work on the same project efficiently. For example, if you want to contribute to the pycontw-blog project hosted on Github, youâ€™ll need to **fork** and **clone** the repository before making changes.  

   More details can be found in the **"Fork & Clone pycontw-blog"** section.

5. Install Git  
    To start using Git for version control, install it on your computer.  

   - Download Git from the official site: [Git Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
   - For step-by-step installation and usage, watch this guide:  
     [Git Installation and Usage Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKXRiAiQFiY&t=103s)

6. Terminal</br>
    The Terminal is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to interact with your computer using text commands. It is essential for running Git commands.

   - On **[macOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac)** and **Linux**, you can use the built-in terminal.  
   - On **[Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/)**, you can use **[Command Prompt](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/command-prompt-commands)** or install **[Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/bash)** to use a Unix-like terminal.  

   Familiarizing yourself with basic terminal commands will make using Git much easier.

## Getting Started
### Environment Setup

1. Fork & Clone [pycontw-blog]

    For those who already know how to fork the repository, you can skip to the next step.

    <details>
    <summary>Click me</summary>

    1. Navigate to [pycontw-blog] and press the `Fork` button
    on the top right corner.
    <img src="./content/images/readme/step_1_fork_repo.png" />

    2. Press `Create fork`

    3. Copy the URL of the forked repo
    <img src="./content/images/readme/step_3_copy_url.png" />
    </details>

2. Clone the forked repo
    > Note: Do not include `< >`, just copy and paste the repository URL directly.

    ```bash
    git clone --recursive <YOUR_URL_HERE>
    ```

    Example (using HTTPS)</br>
    If you are cloning the pycontw-blog repository, use the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/pycontw/pycontw-blog.git
    ```
3. [Install uv]

    Use [uv] to setup the required version of Python.

    1. For MacOS / Linux users

    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    > Note: To check if uv is installed successfully, you can type `uv --version` or `which uv` to see the installation path. If the installation is successful, running `uv --version` will output the version of `uv`.

    2. For Windows users

    ```bash
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

4. Setup Python and install dependencies

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

7. Setup [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks

    This will check common errors when you do certain types of git commits.

    ```bash
    uv run inv setup-pre-commit-hooks
    ```

### Write a new article

#### Quick Start

1. Create a New Branch

    Before creating a post or making any changes (such as bug fixes or feature additions), always create a new branch. This ensures that your work remains separate from the main branch.

    **Important**: Make sure you're on the main branch before creating a new branch. You can switch to the main branch using the following command:

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```

    Then, create a new branch by running the command below, replacing "branch-name" with a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., add-new-post, fix-typo, add-feature-x).

    ```bash
    git checkout -b "branch-name"
    ```

2. Create Post

    Run the following command to create a new post. Follow the steps to fill in all necessary information.

    ```bash
    uv run inv create-post
    ```

    Then open the newly created file under `content/posts` to finish editing the rest of the content body.
    The post is written in Markdown format. You can learn more about Markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

3. Test Locally

    It's very ***IMPORTANT*** to test and run locally before committing anything. Run the following command to host the website locally.

    ```bash
    uv run inv livereload
    ```

    After executing the above command, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`.
    You should be able to see the new post you've just created.

4. Commit

    After all is ready, it's time to commit the modifications to the branch and push to the repository.

    ```bash
    git add <your_file>

    # Use commitizen to do git commit.
    # Choose the "new post" type if you're adding a new article
    uv run cz commit

    # Push to the remote branch.
    git push origin $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
    ```

5. Create a Pull Request

    After pushing to the remote repository, go back to your GitHub page of your forked repository. There should be a very obvious pop up on top of the page like below.

    ![PR step 1](content/images/readme/pr_step_1.png)

    Press that `Compare & pull request` hardly and go to the next page.

    ![PR step 2](content/images/readme/pr_step_2.png)

    Modify the content of the red rectangle 1 and 2. After editing, press the `Create pull request` button. That's it!!

Congratulations!! You've done all the jobs to post a new blog article. The next is taking a rest, drinking a cup of tea, and waiting for the maintainer to come for reviewing your PR ~

#### More about the post

The post could be written in [Markdown] or [reStructuredText] format. The file should put under [content/posts](https://github.com/pycontw/pycontw-blog/tree/main/content/posts) folder. Your filename should be the English title of your article. You'll have to translate it if there's no English title.

The following is a minimal example of an article.
* In markdown
    ```markdown
    Title: My super post
    Date: 2010-12-03 10:20
    Modified: 2010-12-05 19:30

    Slug: my-super-post
    Authors: Alexis Metaireau, Conan Doyle
    Summary: Short version for index and feeds

    This is the content of my super blog post.
    ```

If you need to upload images, you'll need to create a directory for your posts in [content/images/readme/](https://github.com/pycontw/pycontw-blog/tree/main/content/images).
